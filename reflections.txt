You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?

	In the mockup task i learned two new skills. I learned how to use the <hr> tag to create a page width horizontal line and how to use the <sup> to display the text at half the standard font size.

  * What has been easy?
	It was pretty easy to format the page. Most of the layout was pretty straight forward.

  * What has been difficult?
	The most difficult part of this assignment was finding out how to implement the <sup> and <hr> tags.

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
	The Mozilla Developer Network has been extremely helpful with problem solving. Anytime i have gotten stuck i can usually find the answer there or on Stack Overflow.
